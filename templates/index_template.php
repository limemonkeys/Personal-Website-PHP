    I volunteered frequently with the Loaded Ladle for the past year.
    The Loaded Ladle is a non-profit open food cooperative, providing free meal services to the community from Tuesday to Friday. 
    The Loaded Ladle serves upwards of 300 people each day. I have also run a team for the Iron Ladle: A cooking competition in which I assembled a team and planned a recipe for one of the services.
